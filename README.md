## Notice
**All** credit for the six original biomes and the sky village goes to [NotAFunnyBee](https://modrinth.com/user/NotAFunnyBee) in the original [Beyond The Clouds](https://modrinth.com/datapack/beyond-the-clouds) datapack. I only ported this to 1.21 and completed some features.

It is highly recommended you backup your world before adding any datapack, especially world generation datapacks. Datapacks that add new dimensions cannot be removed easily.
